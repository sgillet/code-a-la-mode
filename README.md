## Rules
Control a chef and prepare food for customers as quickly as possible to earn more points than the other players.
 The Game

This is a three-player game played on a grid 11 cells wide and 7 cells high. A match is played in 3 rounds, each round with only 2 of the players.

   Round 1: player A with player B.
   Round 2: player C with player A.
   Round 3: player B with player C.

Each player will thus play two rounds in each match. A player's total points is the sum of both rounds' points.

Each round lasts for 200 turns and is played with the same kitchen and customers.

A round

Each player controls a chef who moves around the kitchen and prepares food for customers.

Both players play collaboratively, and perform their actions one after the other. Each player will have 100 turns to act per round.

The kitchen
The kitchen contains:

   Floor cells, on which the chefs can move (., 0, 1).
   Empty tables (#).
   A dishwasher (D).
   A customer window represented by a bell (W).

It also contains different food crates that dispense:

   Blueberries (B).
   Ice cream (I).


The desserts
The chefs can prepare two basic desserts:

   Blueberries (BLUEBERRIES).
   Ice cream (ICE_CREAM).

   The customers

 At most 3 customers are waiting for their order. Each delivered order rewards both active chefs with points, but the longer the customer waits, the fewer points the chefs get.
 Every customer requests exactly ICE_CREAM and BLUEBERRIES.

 A customer's order should be served on a dish (DISH).

 There are at maximum 3 dishes in play. As soon as an order is sent through the window, a new dish appears in the dishwasher.

 Actions

 MOVE x y

 Use this command to move towards a different cell. The chefs move horizontally and vertically, of 4 cells at most. They can't occupy the same cell or pass through each other.

 USE x y

 Use this command to interact with the cell (x,y). If the chef is adjacent to the cell when using the USE command, the action is successful. Otherwise, the chef will move closer to that cell. The USE command works diagonally (8-adjacency).

 Depending on the cell and what the chef is holding, the USE will have different effects. The main effects are summarized below:

     The USE action on an equipment will make you use that equipment.
     The USE action on a table with an item (food or dish) while holding nothing will make you pick up that item.
     The USE action on a table with a finished dessert while holding a dish will make you add that dessert to the dish.


 WAIT

 Use this command to do nothing.

 To display a message in a viewer, append a semicolon followed by your message to the output.
 Ex: USE 0 0; my message
 Victory Conditions

     You earn more points than your opponents after the three rounds.

 Loss Conditions

     Your program times out.
     Your program provides invalid output.


   Advanced Details

 You can see the game's source code here: https://github.com/csj/code-a-la-mode.

     The chefs cannot exchange any food or dish with each other. They need to put it down on a table for the other to pick it up.
     The chefs cannot put food or dishes on the floor.
     The chefs cannot pick up a dish if they're already carrying one.
     As soon as food is put on a dish, it cannot be removed from it. To empty a dish, USE the dishwasher while holding it.
     A dish cannot contain more than 4 desserts.
     All possible cases of the USE are listed here.
     For every turn a customer waits for an order, the reward is decreased by 1.
